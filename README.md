# 🏃 Sports Injury Risk Detection from Video

An AI-powered web application that analyzes athlete movement from uploaded sports videos to detect injury risks using computer vision, pose estimation, biomechanics analysis, and machine learning techniques.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

Sports injuries are one of the major challenges faced by athletes across different sports. This project assists athletes, coaches, physiotherapists, and sports scientists by providing an AI-based platform that analyzes body posture and movement patterns from uploaded videos to identify potential injury risks before they become severe.

The application combines **React**, **FastAPI**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe Pose Estimation** to provide automated biomechanics analysis, pose tracking, injury risk prediction, processed skeleton videos, and downloadable injury assessment reports.

# 🚀 How to Run

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VeeraNagaDurga/sports-injury-risk-detection.git
```

## Backend

```bash
cd backend

python -m venv .venv

.venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend runs at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

npm install

npm start
```

Frontend runs at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

# � Docker Setup

## Prerequisites

1. Install Docker Desktop.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Configure your local backend environment file at [backend/.env](backend/.env) using the template in [backend/.env.example](backend/.env.example).

## Run the app with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then open:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Stop the app

```bash
docker compose down
```

To stop and remove the PostgreSQL data volume as well (only when intentionally resetting the database):

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

> Warning: `docker compose down -v` deletes the PostgreSQL Docker volume and all stored database data.
